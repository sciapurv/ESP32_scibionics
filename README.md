This wireless bionic arm is controlled via Wi-Fi and seamlessly replicates my real-hand movements from over 20 meters away, thanks to the ESP32. It offers real-time finger movement, making it suitable for applications in humanoid robotics and prosthetics.

With a battery life of 2-3 hours, it can be easily recharged using a regular phone charger, ensuring convenience and portability.
