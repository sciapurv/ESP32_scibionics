This wireless bionic arm is controlled via Wi-Fi and seamlessly replicates my real-hand movements from over 20 meters away, thanks to the ESP32. It offers real-time finger movement, making it suitable for applications in humanoid robotics and prosthetics.

With a battery life of 2-3 hours, it can be easily recharged using a regular phone charger, ensuring convenience and portability.


> Key Features of My Bionic Arm V2:

âœ… Wireless Control - Uses an ESP32-based glove to transmit finger movements to the bionic arm.

âœ… Servo-Powered Motion - Each finger is controlled by servo motors for precise movement.

âœ… Lightweight & Ergonomic Design - Built with A4 foam sheets for a sleek look and a comfortable fit.

âœ… Custom Power System - A 7.4V Li-ion battery pack with a TP4056-based charging system for stable performance.

âœ… Gripping Capability - Can hold and lift objects (though improvements in grip strength are needed).


> Challenges & Learnings:

ðŸ”¸ Gripping is still not perfect, and I realized that foam sheets may not be the best choice for grip.

ðŸ”¸ Higher torque servos are needed for stronger and more reliable movements.

ðŸ”¸ The thumb design needs improvements for a better hold on objects.

Despite these challenges, this version is a major milestone in my journey of building robotic prosthetics! Every failure has been a lesson, and I'm already planning improvements for Bionic Arm V3.
